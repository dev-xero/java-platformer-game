# Java Platformer Game

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fce8e713-7a78-4463-a6ac-4decd5104752)

Bare bones platformer game built from scratch in Java to learn SwingUI. I followed Kaarin's tutorial on YouTube while tweaking a few things.

### Features

- Game loop and performant* rendering with FPS and UPS on a dedicated thread.
- Keyboard (WASD) and mouse input controls.
- Player rendering, movements, animation updates.
- Level manager and rendering - there isn't a level editor yet, levels are constructed using a level color map.

There are a lot of features like sounds, game menus and rendering optimizations left to be implemented.
